 Genshin Impact Tray AIO for Windows.
 
 100% not necessary for the game, but this automates the background 'anticheat' into closing for you.
 Also includes some items in the tray shortcuts (Reddit/Wiki) and a touch of customizability (Silent mode/Close launcher too)
 
 Hopefully someone finds use in it. If not though, that's fine. Was fun to plug out in an afternoon.

 Built for .NET 4.0 so unless you haven't updated since 2011 you should be fine.
